  - Duration: 3h 15' (including a 10' break)

## Motivations & Objectives

The goal of this workshop is to experiment story-driven development, on a real life case study. It is defined as an extension of the _Elephant Carpaccio_'s workshop designed by Alistair Cockburn. When experimenting the _Carpaccio_ with CS students, the main drawback is the artificiality of the case study, and the shortness of the iterations. It is well suited for experimented engineers, but does not suit students as well.

We decided to extend this workshop to address these issues. The idea here is to create a 3 hours session that will support concrete software development using thin stories in its backlogs. It also allows one to discuss about _(i)_ the importance of discussing with the client and _(ii)_ the notion of technical debt in a software product.

## Requirements

  - Audience should be aware of object-oriented software development to understand the initial code given during the kickoff. 
  - Being familiar with the agile mindset  (_e.g._, the idea of continuously delivering value to a customer) is mandatory.
  - Having used stories in a previous project is a plus, but not mandatory. However, knowing the notion of story is mandatory. 
  - Team should be composed of 3 to 4 peoples.
  - Participants must have a programming environment that support Java 8 and maven 3.

  
## Usage

  - As a participant: 
    - `git clone` to gain access to the initial source code;
    - read `PoC.md` to understand the architecture of the Proof of Concept
    - import the code as a Maven 3 project in your favorite IDE
  - As an animator: 
    - look into the `facilitation` directory to find a description of the workshop and the material to print as a support.
